chains
~~~~~~

| *default*: []
| *type*: list
| *title*: Chains to be scored.
| *short description*: List of chains to be scored. If empty/unspecified, all inter-chains contacts will be considered for the final prediction.
| *long description*: List of chains to be scored. If empty/unspecified, all inter-chains contacts will be considered for the final prediction. In specific cases, for example antibody-antigen complexes, some chains should be considered as a single molecule. Use the chains parameter to provide a list of chains that should be considered for the calculation. Use commas to include multiple chains as part of a single group. ["A", "B"]      => Contacts calculated (only) between chains A and B. ["A,B", "C"]    => Contacts calculated (only) between chains A and C; and B and C. ["A", "B", "C"] => Contacts calculated (only) between chains A and B; B and C; and A and C.
