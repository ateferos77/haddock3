allatoms
~~~~~~~~

| *default*: False
| *type*: boolean
| *title*: Atoms to be considered during the analysis.
| *short description*: Atoms to be considered during the analysis.
| *long description*: Atoms to be considered during the analysis. If false (default), only backbone atoms will be considered, otherwise all the heavy-atoms.
| *group*: analysis
| *explevel*: easy

atom_similarity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *default*: 90.0
| *type*: float
| *title*: Required atom similarity
| *min*: 10.0
| *max*: 100.0
| *short description*: Required similarity (in %) between the number of atoms in the input models.
| *long description*: Required similarity (in %) between the number of atoms in the input models. If the similarity is higher than this value, the RMSD calculation is performed on the common atoms. Otherwise, the calculation is stopped. The lower the value the looser the checks.
| *group*: analysis
| *explevel*: easy

contact_distance_cutoff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *default*: 5.0
| *type*: float
| *title*: Distance cutoff defining a contact.
| *min*: 0.1
| *max*: 30.0
| *short description*: Cutoff distance (in Angstrom) defining a contact.
| *long description*: Distance (in Angstrom) cutoff defining a contact. Any atoms within this cutoff range will be used to define the interface. Standard values are usually 3.9 A or 5.0 A.
| *group*: analysis
| *explevel*: easy

ligand_chains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *default*: ['B']
| *type*: list
| *title*: Ligand ChainIDs
| *short description*: Ligand ChainIDs to be considered for the IL-RMSD calculations.
| *long description*: Ligand ChainIDs to be considered for the IL-RMSD calculations. This determines which chains will be treated as the ligand for the IL-RMSD.
| *group*: analysis
| *explevel*: easy

receptor_chain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *default*: 'A'
| *type*: string
| *title*: Receptor ChainID
| *short description*: Receptor ChainID to be considered for the RMSD calculations.
| *long description*: Receptor ChainID to be considered for the RMSD calculations. This determines which chain will be treated as the receptor for the L-RMSD and for I-L-RMSD.
| *group*: analysis

max_models
~~~~~~~~~~

| *default*: 10000
| *type*: integer
| *title*: Maximum number of models
| *min*: 1
| *max*: 20000
| *short description*: Maximum number of models to be considered when calculating the matrix.
| *long description*: Maximum number of models to be considered when calculating the matrix. If the number of models in the input file is larger than this number, the execution will be aborted.
| *group*: analysis
