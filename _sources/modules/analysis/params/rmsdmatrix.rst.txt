max_models
~~~~~~~~~~

| *default*: 10000
| *type*: integer
| *title*: Maximum number of models to calculate RMSD matrix
| *min*: 1
| *max*: 20000
| *short description*: If the number of models exceeds max_models the execution is blocked
| *long description*: If the number of models exceeds the few thousands, the calculation of the RMSD matrix is computationally demanding, especially in terms of CPU and disk space.
| *group*: 
| *explevel*: easy

resdic_
~~~~~~~

| *default*: []
| *type*: list
| *title*: List of residues
| *short description*: The residue numbers that should be used in the alignment and in the RMSD calculation.
| *long description*: resdic_* is an expandable parameter. You can provide resdic_A, resdic_B, resdic_C, etc, where the last capital letter is the chain identifier.
