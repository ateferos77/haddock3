allatoms
~~~~~~~~

| *default*: False
| *type*: boolean
| *title*: Atoms to be considered during the analysis.
| *short description*: Atoms to be considered during the analysis.
| *long description*: Atoms to be considered during the analysis. If false (default), only backbone atoms will be considered, otherwise all the heavy-atoms.
| *group*: analysis
| *explevel*: easy

atom_similarity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *default*: 90.0
| *type*: float
| *title*: Required atom similarity
| *min*: 10.0
| *max*: 100.0
| *short description*: Required similarity (in %) between the number of atoms in the input models.
| *long description*: Required similarity (in %) between the number of atoms in the input models. If the similarity is higher than this value, the RMSD calculation is performed on the common atoms. Otherwise, the calculation is stopped. The lower the value the looser the checks.
| *group*: analysis
| *explevel*: easy

max_models
~~~~~~~~~~

| *default*: 10000
| *type*: integer
| *title*: Maximum number of models to calculate RMSD matrix
| *min*: 1
| *max*: 20000
| *short description*: If the number of models exceeds max_models the execution is blocked
| *long description*: If the number of models exceeds the few thousands, the calculation of the RMSD matrix is computationally demanding, especially in terms of CPU and disk space.
| *group*: analysis
| *explevel*: easy

resdic_
~~~~~~~

| *default*: []
| *type*: list
| *title*: List of residues
| *short description*: The residue numbers that should be used in the alignment and in the RMSD calculation.
| *long description*: resdic_* is an expandable parameter. You can provide resdic_A, resdic_B, resdic_C, etc, where the last capital letter is the chain identifier.
| *group*: analysis
| *explevel*: easy
